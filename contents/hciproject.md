### **PROJECT1: Aquatic-Friendly UST Campus**  
**September 2025**  

#### Description: 
This project is dedicated to designing and developing aquatic-friendly perspectives and solutions for students from the Aquatic Kingdom of Atlantics visiting HKUST. The initiative focuses on creating an inclusive, accessible, and welcoming environment that acknowledges and accommodates the unique physiological, cultural, and communicative needs of aquatic beings. Through a human-centered design approach, we aimed to reimagine campus facilities, social programs, and communication tools to ensure that every visiting student can fully participate in academic and cultural life while feeling respected and valued.


#### Key Contributions:  
- Researched aquatic students' needs and potential challenges before class to guide group discussion.

- Proposed solutions across three areas: environmental adaptation, language communication, and social inclusion.

- Collaborated on mind map development, improving structure and visual clarity.
